# Verification and limitations

`main` develops the TypeScript/Electron application, currently **0.5.0-beta.3**.
The previous C# application and its published releases remain available through
existing tags/assets. This source transition does not publish a new release or
establish that every compatibility gate has passed.

[Commands and fixtures](../tests/README.md) describe the current suites. Detailed
run history, failed automation attempts, package hashes and evidence boundaries
are in the [development reference](../desktop/REWRITE.md). Private lab identifiers,
recordings and local state belong outside this repository.

## Beta.3 installer verification

Linux and Windows `npm run verify` passed **865 tests in 14 files**, strict
type checking, lint and production bundles, exit 0. Windows native compilation,
**31 native checks**, **8 isolated vault interoperability cases / 136 C# fixture
checks**, and **12 Electron UI workflows**, none skipped, also exited 0.
Update-controller fixtures cover explicit actions, blocked restarts, safe failure
messages, disabled portable/previews and retained Settings drafts. These mocked
checks are separate from actual installer/update delivery.

The per-user NSIS installation and local HTTP update from a test installation of
beta.2 to the unchanged beta.3 installer passed **17 checks**, exit 0. The real
updater recovered from an unavailable feed, rejected a same-size corrupted
installer, downloaded the valid installer, restarted at beta.3 READY and retained
the synthetic DPAPI vault byte for byte. A separate isolated relaunch loaded the
saved key; uninstall exited 0 and retained that vault. The Windows shell restart
used the normal account profile, whose existing vault hashes were checked
separately. No model request or key export was needed. This verifies local update
mechanics; a published GitHub installer feed is still required for public updates.

The beta.3 portable package also passed five standalone duplicate launches,
retained Settings/input drafts, system-only-PATH startup, x64 payload, READY
version and normal exit. ZIP entries/CRCs/EXE bytes and installer metadata
SHA-512/size were checked separately. The first packaging follow-up expected a
`beta.yml` file, but this GitHub configuration generates `latest.yml` even for a
prerelease; copying the actual generated metadata resolved that harness issue.
Two retained installer attempts stopped on harness limitations (main-context
import and an incorrect assumption about the post-update profile) before the
corrected full scenario passed. Those attempts remain separate from the passing
result; no production workaround was made.

## Beta.2 evidence

The stabilized source passed these checks on 2026-10-24, each command exit 0:

| Check | Result and scope |
| --- | --- |
| Linux and Windows `npm run verify` | 846 tests in 12 files, strict type checking, lint and production bundles. Provider/crop fixtures remain synthetic. |
| Windows native build | Real MSVC x64 compile/link against Electron headers; existing nonfatal compiler warnings remain. |
| Windows native harness | 31 checks covering real JPEG capture/crops, DPAPI, loopback transport, activation and disposal. |
| C#/TypeScript vault interoperability | 8 isolated cases, with 136 C# fixture checks. |
| Electron UI | 11 workflows passed, none skipped; 6 use the production native bridge. |
| Standalone source runtime | Seven duplicate launches, Settings drafts/input retention and restored final panel size. |
| Beta.2 EXE/ZIP | Five packaged duplicate launches, direct portable startup/version/normal exit, system-only PATH and archive integrity/byte checks. |

The package was delivered locally and remains unpublished on GitHub. Removing the
historical C# application and updating development/test instructions do not change
the beta's production source. Its existing binary and packaged README retain
their own snapshot; a newer source README does not rewrite distributed bytes.

The initial beta.2 Linux CI run failed one input-focus assertion before React's
focus effect completed. The corrected test waits for that same strict condition
without sleeps or retries. Earlier failed validation/automation attempts remain
recorded separately; successful follow-ups do not erase those failures.

## Platform support

The application targets Windows x64 and has runtime evidence on Windows 11.
Windows 10, fresh-account/machine startup without installed development tools,
mixed-DPI placement, every resize edge, competing-process shortcut rollback and
foreign-account vault rejection still need dedicated checks. Removing tools from
PATH in a development VM is not a fresh-machine check. Linux supports portable
verification and bundle generation; it cannot run the production interface.

## Capture-exclusion checks

The beta requests Windows capture protection for its windows and owned popups,
and reports `Excluded`, `ContentHidden` or `Failed`. Affinity assertions and
native compilation do not establish actual exclusion from a saved recording or
received stream. The visible tray icon remains part of the Windows taskbar.

On Windows 10 version 2004 and later, SC requests omission from supported capture
paths. Earlier Windows 10 builds request blanked window content, so the window
itself may remain visible. If omission fails, the bridge also attempts content
hiding and reports the resulting status. Actual output still depends on the recorder.

Run the production EXE with `--capture-test-only` for a key-free test panel. Keep
it visible locally, record/share the entire monitor using a named recorder or
receiver, then inspect the saved video or received stream on another device.
Also check answer/input, Settings and the owned color picker. Record the app,
Windows and recorder versions, capture method, counts, exit status where
applicable and observed limits. A browser-tab recording does not test whole-monitor
capture. Successful OBS output cannot establish a Discord or browser result.

For beta.3, **Settings → Updates** was visibly present locally and omitted from
one saved **Microsoft Edge 156.0.4314.42 whole-monitor getDisplayMedia / VP8 WebM**
recording on Windows 11. The track reported `displaySurface: monitor`, 1920×1080;
recorded frames while Settings was visible matched the underlying background
when hidden. This evidence covers that pane in that recorder path only. Other
surfaces, Chrome/OBS/Discord paths and receiver output remain unverified for the
TypeScript beta. Historical OBS 32.2.2 Display Capture evidence applies only to
C# v0.4.8. Capture exclusion remains best effort.

## Live providers and model quality

All six provider adapters have mocked transport coverage. Native networking tests
use loopback HTTP; these and green CI do not establish provider-account access,
real answer accuracy, latency or cost. The TypeScript beta has no completed
representative live-provider quality campaign.

The historical C# v0.4.14 DeepSeek campaign used 16 requests. Six of seven initial
primary answers passed; an automatic Thorough diagram answer failed. A separate
fixed-region diagnostic passed without resolving that earlier failure. These
results retain their C# scope and do not establish TypeScript parity or guaranteed
answer accuracy. The full [historical evidence](https://github.com/Ziyadin23/ScreenCompanion/blob/v0.4.14/docs/VERIFICATION.md)
remains available in the release tag.

## Release regression evidence

Historical C# suites, source-layout checks and live trials are archived in the
[v0.4.14 verification record](https://github.com/Ziyadin23/ScreenCompanion/blob/v0.4.14/docs/VERIFICATION.md).
Their assertion counts and recorder results do not verify the new native bridge
or Electron surfaces. The application may become the primary source before all
stable-release gates pass; document those open gates until they are verified.
